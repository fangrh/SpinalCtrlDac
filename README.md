This is the spinalHDL project to control the AD5791. Include suddent change the voltage and ramp the voltage.
Use the template of [https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalTemplateSbt.git](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalTemplateSbt.git)

# How to use
I recommand use the "VSCODE" and "metals" extensions.
1. Install the VSCODE and Metals "scala" extensions.
2. Install JDK 8+ and set the JAVA_HOME
3. Open the project with the VSCODE and wait for metals build.

Or you can use the Docker project I am highly recommend[https://github.com/zao111222333/spinalhdl-online](https://github.com/zao111222333/spinalhdl-online). But make sure that the SpinalHDL version is 1.5.0. Otherwise it may occur error because the syntex of the SpinalHDL later version change.
